# Flight-Club-API
Program that uses API calls to auto search for flight deals for up to 5 cities and send out an email to the user if the deal price is below their own price ceiling. Can support multiple users with differing flight preferences (home airport, desired destinations, price ceilings, 'Surprise Me' feature). The program uses Kiwi flight API for the searching, Sheety API for collecting and storing the user preferences into a GoogleSheet, Twilio SMS service to alert the dev of any issues, and Gmail SMTP to send out weekly emails to users with the deals (with links to those flights on Kayak.com and Kiwi.com)
